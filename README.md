## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm **oh-rio**, nice to meet you all.
I'm currently in college and i look forward to actually taking interest in what i'm learning instead of watching youtube videos all day.
I can help you with things regarding philosophy, after all computer science and morality go hand in hand, even more so than mathematics (maths boo).
I hope no one sees this.
And finally, *carpe diem* or something like that.
